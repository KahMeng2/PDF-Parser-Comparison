- Multi-forms: 9.3/10
- **Complex psychiatric records: 9.4/10**

**LlamaParse**: Good performance but struggles with organization

- Simple documents: 9.5/10
- Complex tables: 7.3/10
- Multi-forms: 7.8/10
- **Complex psychiatric records: 8.1/10**

**Mistral OCR**: Declining performance with increased complexity

- Simple documents: 9.2/10
- Complex tables: 8.7/10
- Multi-forms: 6.9/10
- **Complex psychiatric records: 6.8/10**

### Medical Documentation Standards:

1. **Claude**: Meets all professional medical documentation standards
2. **LlamaParse**: Acceptable quality with some organizational improvements needed
3. **Mistral OCR**: Below professional standards due to formatting issues and errors
