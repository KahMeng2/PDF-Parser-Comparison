| The patient is a 55 year old white male who presented with typical symptoms of pneumococcal pneumonia with the initial chest X-Ray showing a right lower lobe infiltrate. An initial ABG revealed a respiratory alkalosis and a pO2 of 55 on room air.                                                                                                                                                |     |
| 1. Pneumonia – The patient was initially treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Subsequent blood cultures revealed a sensitive pneumococcus. Symptoms improved and repeat chest X-ray did not reveal evidence of a pleural effusion. WBC count the day prior to discharge was 12,000 with a normal differential. Pulse oximetry was 95% on room air on the day of discharge,                      |     |
| 2. Type 2 Diabetes – Initially, blood sugars were difficult to control. He was treated with basal, prandial, and correctional insulin with an average blood sugar of 150 on the day prior to discharge.                                                                                                                                                                                               |     |
| 3. Congestive Heart Failure – The patient had a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy with a normal cardiac catheterization in 2002. An echocardiogram was performed with results as above. Based on the improvement of his dyspnea with treatment of his pneumonia, it was thought that CHF was not the cause of his admitting symptoms. His lisinopril dose was increased from 10 mg to 20 mg daily. |     |
| 4. Hyponatremia – The patient’s initial sodium level was 126. This was thought to be due to either SIADH from his pneumonia or due to CHF. With the treatment above, his sodium improved and on the day prior to discharge was 137.                                                                                                                                                                   |     |
