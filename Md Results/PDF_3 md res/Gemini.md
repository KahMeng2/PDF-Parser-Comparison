## History and Hospital Course

[cite_start]The patient is a 55-year-old white male who presented with typical symptoms of pneumococcal pneumonia with the initial chest X-Ray showing a right lower lobe infiltrate[cite: 194]. [cite_start]An initial ABG revealed a respiratory alkalosis and a pO2 of 55 on room air[cite: 195].

1.  [cite_start]**Pneumonia**: The patient was initially treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin[cite: 196]. [cite_start]Subsequent blood cultures revealed a sensitive pneumococcus[cite: 196]. [cite_start]Symptoms improved and a repeat chest X-ray did not reveal evidence of a pleural effusion[cite: 197]. [cite_start]The WBC count the day prior to discharge was 12,000 with a normal differential[cite: 198]. [cite_start]Pulse oximetry was 95% on room air on the day of discharge[cite: 199].
2.  [cite_start]**Type 2 Diabetes**: Initially, blood sugars were difficult to control[cite: 200]. [cite_start]He was treated with basal, prandial, and correctional insulin with an average blood sugar of 150 on the day prior to discharge[cite: 201].
3.  [cite_start]**Congestive Heart Failure**: The patient had a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy with a normal cardiac catheterization in 2002[cite: 202]. [cite_start]An echocardiogram was performed with results as above[cite: 202]. [cite_start]Based on the improvement of his dyspnea with treatment of his pneumonia, it was thought that CHF was not the cause of his admitting symptoms[cite: 203]. [cite_start]His lisinopril dose was increased from 10 mg to 20 mg daily[cite: 204].
4.  [cite_start]**Hyponatremia**: The patient's initial sodium level was 126[cite: 205]. [cite_start]This was thought to be due to either SIADH from his pneumonia or due to CHF[cite: 205]. [cite_start]With the treatment above, his sodium improved and on the day prior to discharge was 137[cite: 206].

- [cite_start]**Other discharge labs**: TSH-3.4 [cite: 207]
