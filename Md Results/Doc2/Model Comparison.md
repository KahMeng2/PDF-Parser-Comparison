## Key Findings

**Universal Success:** All models achieved perfect content capture (100%) for this medical discharge summary, demonstrating strong performance on well-structured clinical documents.

**Formatting Distinction:** While content accuracy was universal, formatting quality varied:

- Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini provided excellent markdown structure
- LlamaParse maintained good organization
- Mistral OCR's table format reduced usability despite complete content capture

**Document Type Impact:** This medical summary's clear, standardized structure appears much easier for LLMs to process compared to the complex ED observation chart from the previous assessment.

**Recommendation:** Any of the top 4 models (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, LlamaParse) are suitable for medical document conversion, with formatting preferences determining the final choice. Mistral OCR captures content but requires post-processing for optimal presentation.
