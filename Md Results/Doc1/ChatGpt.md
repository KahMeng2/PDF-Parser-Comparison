- 174.8 Malignant neoplasm of female breast: Other specified sites of female breast
- 163.8 Other specified sites of pleura

## Hospital Discharge Procedures

1. CPT 32650 – Thoracoscopy with chest tube placement and pleurodesis

## History of Present Illness

The patient is a very pleasant, 70-year-old female with a history of breast cancer originally diagnosed in the early 1970s. At that time she underwent radical mastectomy followed by radiotherapy. In the mid-1970s she developed a chest wall recurrence treated with additional radiation. She remained disease–free until the late 1980s, when bone metastases were identified in her sacroiliac joint, right trochanter, and left sacral area. She was started on Tamoxifen and did well until recently, when she developed progressive shortness of breath and was found to have a large pleural effusion.

The effusion was tapped twice but reaccumulated rapidly, prompting admission for thoracoscopy with pleurodesis. Of note, her CA 15-3 tumor marker was 44 in the mid-1990s and recently rose to 600.

## Physical Examination on Admission

- General: Thin, pleasant female in mild respiratory distress
- Lymph nodes: No adenopathy
- Respiratory: Decreased breath sounds up to three-quarters height on the right; a few scattered rales on the left
- Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs
- Abdomen: No hepatosplenomegaly
- Extremities: No peripheral clubbing, cyanosis, or edema

## Studies Summary

- Chest X-ray: Large right pleural effusion

## Hospital Course

- CT scan suggested a trapped lung with pleural adhesions.
- Thoracoscopy confirmed a pleural tumor peel and multiple adhesions, which were lysed.
- Two chest tubes were placed for four days.
- A talc slurry was instilled, and tubes were removed the next day.
- The possibility of pleurodesis failure due to trapped lung was discussed with patient and family.
- Arimidex was discontinued due to nausea and vomiting; Megace was initiated during this admission.

## Discharge Plan & Follow-up

- Transfer to an extended-care facility for rehabilitation until medically stable for home discharge.
- Medications on discharge:
  - Tylenol with Codeine, PRN for pain
  - Megestrol acetate (Megace)
  - Multivitamin
- Follow-up appointment with Dr. Follow in three weeks, including a chest X-ray.
- Patient/facility to call the oncology team with any interim concerns.

**Prognosis:** Guarded, given her debilitated state and pleural disease; pleural fluid may recur despite pleurodesis.
